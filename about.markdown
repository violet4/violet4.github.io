I'm a recent college graduate (May 2020) passionate about cybersecurity, digital privacy, and being aware of, analyzing, understanding, preventing, and mitigating cyber threats. I graduated with a BS in CS with cum laude from SJSU and focused my studies on information security, computer networks, relational and NoSQL databases, machine learning, and AI while working as a Software Engineer at an information technology startup called Carjojo. I'm seeking entry level positions in the cybersecurity industry as Cybersecurity Researcher, Cybersecurity Engineer, Penetration Tester, Security Operations Analyst, or similar positions.
